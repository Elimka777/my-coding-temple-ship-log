how to use compass? Well, below you'll find some instructions to implement in real world experience. There are also a lot of info on Google.
Hold your compass flat with the direction of travel arrow pointing away from you and directly at the landmark. Now rotate the bezel until the magnetized needle is inside the orienting arrow. Look at the index line to read the bearing you've just captured.
